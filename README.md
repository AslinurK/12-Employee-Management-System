# 12-Employee-Management-System

Welcome to Employee Tracker!

As a business owner, you will be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in your company.

This app uses MySQL, Inquirer, and console table to organize and make changes to employee information.

First, you have to run the schema.sql and seed.sql code in your SQL server so you have the necessary database and tables. You will then need to go into your downloaded version and input your SQL password into the connection.js file. 

To install the node packages, use the command below:

$ npm i

To run the package after you've installed it, run the command below:

$ node server.js
